I obtained my B.S. degree at Beihang University (2014~2018). I am a joint Phd student between Beihang University and Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), supervised by Prof. Zhoujun Li. Now, I'm focusing on multilingual pretraining and translation in NLC team of MSRA (Mentor: Dongdong Zhang), which is also my Ph.D. topic.

My primary research interests are in natural language processing, particularly multilingual pre-training, multilingual generation and multilingual understanding.
